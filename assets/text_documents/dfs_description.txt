Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing graph data structures. 
It starts at the start node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
In the implementation, it is basically the same as BFS, but uses a stack instead of a queue. 
This also allows different recursive implementations.
